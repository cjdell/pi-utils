pi-utils - Utilities for managing networks of Raspberry Pis
===========================================================

I decided to collect various scripts I had written into one file so I can include it on many Raspberry Pi's.

It includes:

-   A script to turn a Pi into DHCP server. Useful for adhoc Pi networks.
-   A script to install BitTorrent Sync, keeps documents/projects in sync between many Pi's. Saves having to deploy individually
-   A script to discover all Pi's on the network with both IP and MAC addresses listed.
-   Tools to config SSH keys on Pi's for password-less communication i.e. SSH/SCP/Rsync
-   The ability to flash a Pi remotely with a new operating system without the need for external SD card readers (Experimental, but cool!)
-   More to come...

I will be adding more scripts to this file. I welcome feedback, especially if you believe you know a better way to do things.
